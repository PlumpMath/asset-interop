# asset-interop
Documentation on extensions to the HyperCat(-alogue) to allow asset interoperabilty in Smart Cities and IoT. With example Java code showing how to tap a BACnet device and produce an Asset Interop compliant message from it.

This repo contains a Word doc that outlines a viable Asset Interoperability Protocol that extends the HyperCat catalogue standard to permit the reporting of individual and bulk sensor data, from one or more endpoints, in order to allow for greater interoperability between assets and the server platforms they communicate with.

The example Java code is built on top of the open-source (GPL) Serotonin libraries: Bacnet4J. We are pleased to acknowledge that foundation.

The example code may, of course, be taken and extended to allow integration of any legacy BMS or similar protocol with the asset interoperability protocol described here.

Enjoy!
